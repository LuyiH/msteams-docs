   Start Microsoft Teams app development with your first Teams AI library app. 
    
   You can create a conversational bot for Microsoft Teams that thinks it's a Chef to help you cook Teams apps and illustrates basic conversational bot behavior in Microsoft Teams. The bot is built to allow GPT to facilitate the conversation on its behalf, using only a natural language prompt file to guide it.
    
   In this tutorial, you'll learn:

   - How to set up a new project with Teams Toolkit.
   - How to import Teams AI library capabilities.
   - How to deploy your bot in Teams and start a conversation.

   You can see the following output:

   ## Prepare development environment

   After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.

   ### Install the Teams Toolkit

   The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams Store, and more. 
    
   You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `Teamsapp`.

   # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

   1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
   1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
   1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/install-toolkit-vscodeversion.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation." lightbox="~/assets\images\teams-toolkit-v2\prerequisites\install-toolkit-vscodeversion-1.png":::

    The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code **Activity Bar** after it's installed.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar.":::

   You can also find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

   # [Command line](#tab/cli)

   To install the Teamsapp CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

   ``` bash
   npm install -g @microsoft/teamsapp-cli
   ```

   Depending on your configuration, you might need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

   ``` bash
   sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsapp-cli
   ```

   This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

   Ensure you add the npm global cache to your path. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.

   You can use the CLI with the `teamsapp` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsapp -h`.

   > [!CAUTION]
   > Before you can run Teamsapp in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the 'remote signed' execution policy for PowerShell.

   ## Set up your Teams development tenant

   A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where your upload and test your custom app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

   ### Check for custom app upload option

   After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as custom app upload. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Custom app upload is necessary for previewing and testing apps in Teams local environment. If it isn't enabled, you won't be able to preview and test your app in Teams local environment.

   Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

   Verify if you can upload a custom app in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select the **Apps** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Select **Upload an app**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, custom app upload is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/spfx-custom-new1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the bot home.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > Contact your Teams administrator, if you don't find the option to upload a custom app.

   ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

   If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

   1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
   1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
   1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
   1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

       :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/microsoft-365.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Microsoft 365 Developer Program.":::

   1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

   ## Get a free Azure account

   If you want to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

   Now you’ve got all the tools to set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building! Select the app you want to build first.

    Let's create your first bot app.
    
    The bot capability of a Teams app creates a chatbot or a conversational bot. You use it to run simple and automated tasks, for example, providing customer service. A bot talks with a web service and helps you use its offerings. You can get weather forecast, make reservations, or any other service offered using a conversational bot.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-bot/your-helloworld-app-bot.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Bot is highlighted.":::
    
    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the bot app.

    ## Update your bot app with Teams AI library capabilities

    Teams Toolkit is the easiest way to scaffold and get a bot running. Teams Toolkit creates the basic bot structure for you to get started with configuring your bot. 
    
    Let's get started to configure Teams AI library capabilities.

    1. Go to Visual Studio Code and open a terminal window.
    
    1. Run the following command in the terminal to install `yarn`:

       ```bash
       npm install -g yarn@1.21.1
       
       ```

    1. Run the following command to add the latest version of the Teams AI in the sample:

       ```bash
       yarn install
       yarn build
       Yarn start

       ```

    1. Run the following command to install the latest published version of Teams AI:

       ```bash
       npm install --workspaces=false
       npm run build
       npm start

       ```


    1. Go to **Explorer** > **env**. 
    
       1. For OpenAI: Go to **.env.local.user**, enter the OpenAI key that you've generated.

            ```env/.env.local
                SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=********************
            ```

       1. For Azure OpenAI: Go to **.env.local.user**, enter the Azure OpenAI key, endpoint, and deployment that you've generated.

            ```env/.env.local
                SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=********************
                AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://********.openai.azure.com/
                AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=********************
            ```

       > [!NOTE]
       > If you’re creating the sample through Teams Toolkit, you’ll find the `.env.local.user` file in the setup that is created automatically. If the file isn't available, create the .env.local.user file and update the OpenAI key or Azure Open AI endpoint.

    1. Go to the `index.ts` file:

        1. Under **Import required packages** add the following code before import * as restify from 'restify':

            ```typescript
            import { config } from 'dotenv';
            import * as path from 'path';
            ```
        
        1. After import * as restify from 'restify' add the following code:

            ```typescript
            // Import required bot services.
            // See https://aka.ms/bot-services to learn more about the different parts of a bot.
            import { ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory, MemoryStorage, TurnContext } from 'botbuilder';
            ```
        
        1. After **ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory** add the following code:

            ```typescript
            import {
                ActionPlanner,
                Application,
                DefaultConversationState,
                Memory,
                OpenAIModel,
                PromptManager,
                TeamsAdapter,
                TurnState
            } from '@microsoft/teams-ai';

            ```
        
        1. After '@microsoft/teams-ai add the following code:
        
            ```typescript
            // Read botFilePath and botFileSecret from .env file.
            const ENV_FILE = path.join(__dirname, '..', '.env');
            config({ path: ENV_FILE });

            ```
        1. After config({ path: ENV_FILE }); add the following code: 

            ```typescript
            // Create adapter.
            // See https://aka.ms/about-bot-adapter to learn more about how bots work.
            const adapter = new TeamsAdapter(
                {},
                new ConfigurationServiceClientCredentialFactory({
                    MicrosoftAppId: process.env.BOT_ID,
                    MicrosoftAppPassword: process.env.BOT_PASSWORD,
                    MicrosoftAppType: 'MultiTenant'
                })
            );
            ```

       1. After MicrosoftAppType: 'MultiTenant' add the following code: 

            ```typescript

            // Catch-all for errors.
            const onTurnErrorHandler = async (context: TurnContext, error: Error) => {
                // This check writes out errors to console log .vs. app insights.
                // NOTE: In production environment, you should consider logging this to Azure
                //       application insights.
                console.error(`\n [onTurnError] unhandled error: ${error.toString()}`);
                console.log(error);

                // Send a trace activity, which will be displayed in Bot Framework Emulator
                await context.sendTraceActivity(
                    'OnTurnError Trace',
                    `${error.toString()}`,
                    'https://www.botframework.com/schemas/error',
                    'TurnError'
                );

                // Send a message to the user
                await context.sendActivity('The bot encountered an error or bug.');
                await context.sendActivity('To continue to run this bot, please fix the bot source code.');
            };
            ```   

        1. After await context.sendActivity('To continue to run this bot, please fix the bot source code.'); add the following code:

            ```typescript
            // Set the onTurnError for the singleton CloudAdapter.
            adapter.onTurnError = onTurnErrorHandler;
            ```

        1. Update `// Create HTTP server.` with the following code:

            ```typescript
            // Create HTTP server.
            const server = restify.createServer();
            server.use(restify.plugins.bodyParser());

            server.listen(process.env.port || process.env.PORT || 3978, () => {
                console.log(`\n${server.name} listening to ${server.url}`);
                console.log('\nGet Bot Framework Emulator: https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator');
                console.log('\nTo test your bot in Teams, sideload the app manifest.json within Teams Apps.');
            });
            ```

        1. After console.log('\nTo test your bot in Teams, sideload the app manifest.json within Teams Apps.'); add the following code:

            ```typescript
            // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
            interface ConversationState extends DefaultConversationState {
                lightsOn: boolean;
            }
            type ApplicationTurnState = TurnState<ConversationState>;

            if (!process.env.OPENAI_KEY && !process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY) {
                throw new Error('Missing environment variables - please check that OPENAI_KEY or AZURE_OPENAI_KEY is set.');
            }
            ```

       1. After , add the following code in a new line to define prompt function:

            ```typescript
            // Define a prompt function for getting the current status of the lights
            planner.prompts.addFunction('getLightStatus', async (context: TurnContext, memory: Memory) => {
                return memory.getValue('conversation.lightsOn') ? 'on' : 'off';
            });

            ```

    1. Go to the `app.ts` file:

        1. In `// Create AI components`, update `defaultModel` with the following code:

            ```typescript
            defaultModel: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
            ```
        1. In `const planner = new ActionPlanner({`, update `defaultPrompt` with the following code:

            ```typescript
            defaultPrompt: 'chat',
            ```
        1. For Azure OpenAI: Replace the code for '//OpenAI Support' with the following code:
        
            ```typescript
                
                    // Azure OpenAI Support
                    azureApiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY!,
                    azureDefaultDeployment: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
                    azureEndpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT!,
                    azureApiVersion: '2023-03-15-preview',
            ```

    1. After `// Define storage and application`,  add the following code:

           ```typescript
              // Register action handlers
              app.ai.action('LightsOn', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
                  state.conversation.lightsOn = true;
                  await context.sendActivity(`[lights on]`);
                  return `the lights are now on`;
            });

              app.ai.action('LightsOff', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState) => {
                  state.conversation.lightsOn = false;
                  await context.sendActivity(`[lights off]`);
                  return `the lights are now off`;
            });

            interface PauseParameters {
                time: number;
            }

            app.ai.action('Pause', async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, parameters: PauseParameters) => {
                await context.sendActivity(`[pausing for ${parameters.time / 1000} seconds]`);
                await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, parameters.time));
                return `done pausing`;
            });

           ```


































        1. Under **Import required packages** addafter `console.log` method, add the following code in a new line to import Teams AI library:

            ```typescript
            import { AI, Application, ActionPlanner, OpenAIModel, PromptManager, TurnState } from '@microsoft/teams-ai';
            import { addResponseFormatter } from './responseFormatter';
            import { VectraDataSource } from './VectraDataSource';
            ```

            You need to import the required classes to use the functions and variables available in the class to build your app. You can use pre-built templates and add your business logic to this scaffold.

        1. After `import path from "path"`, add the following code in a new line to define a state:

            ```typescript
            // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-interface
            interface ConversationState {}
            type ApplicationTurnState = TurnState<ConversationState>;

            ```

            The `ApplicationTurnState` is the typescript **type** of the turn state object state. End users can create their own **conversation** or **user** concrete type implementations and provide it to the `TurnState` interface.
        
        1. After `type ApplicationTurnState`, add the following code in a new line:

           ```typescript
           if (!process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY) {
            throw new Error('Missing environment variables - please check that OPENAI_KEY or AZURE_OPENAI_KEY is set.');
           }
           ```

        1. After `throw new Error`.
        
           1. For OpenAI: Add the following code in a new line to create `OpenAIModel`, `promptManager`, and `ActionPlanner`:

            ```typescript
            // Create AI components
            const model = new OpenAIModel({
            // OpenAI Support
              apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
              defaultModel: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',

            // Request logging
            logRequests: true
            });

            const prompts = new PromptManager({
                promptsFolder: path.join(__dirname, '../src/prompts')
            });

            const planner = new ActionPlanner({
                model,
                prompts,
                defaultPrompt: 'chat',
            });
            ````

            * Planner: The `OpenAIPlanner` is a class that implements an interface called `Planner`. Planner calls the OpenAI's large language model (LLM)s `text-davinci-003` model for text completion. You can use the `OpenAIPlanner` or AzureOpenAIPlanner. If your using the AzureOpenAIPlanner, ensure that you define the endpoint property.

            * PromptManager: `promptManager` Allows you to register your prompts and load a prompt template into the AI component. All the functions related to the prompt manager are available in the `DefaultPromptManager`.  The prompt manager parses the prompts defined in the `prompt` folder. You can replace or override your own functionality in the prompt manager. 

            * Moderator: The `OpenAIModerator` reviews both user's input and the model output to detect harmful speech, such as hate speech, self-harm, and violence.

           1. For Azure OpenAI: Replace the code for '//OpenAI Support' with the following code:
        
                ```typescript
                 
                        // Azure OpenAI Support
                        azureApiKey: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_KEY!,
                        azureDefaultDeployment: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
                        azureEndpoint: process.env.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT!,
                        azureApiVersion: '2023-03-15-preview',
                ```

                Teams AI library for Azure OpenAI is built with Azure AI Content Safety which detects harmful user-generated and AI-generated content in applications and services. Content Safety includes text and image APIs that allow you to detect material that is harmful. For more information, see [Azure AI Content Safety](/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview). You can also use [Moderation APIs](/azure/ai-services/content-moderator/overview#moderation-apis) to personalize your bot to a specific language or a style.

        1. After `const promptManager`, add the following code in a new line to define storage and application:

            ```typescript
            // Define storage and application
            const storage = new MemoryStorage();
            const app = new Application<ApplicationTurnState>({
                storage,
                ai: {
                    planner,
                }
            });
            ```

            * The `Application` class replaces the Teams Activity Handler class from Bot Framework SDK. The application class has all the information and bot logic required for an app. You can register actions or activity handlers for the app in this class.
            * The `MemoryStorage` class is a memory based storage provider that stores and retrieves plan old JSON objects. It's imported from the Bot Builder SDK.

       
        1.  After adding the code to define storage and application, add the following code in a new line to define data sources:

           ```typescript
           // Register your data source with planner
            planner.prompts.addDataSource(new VectraDataSource({
                name: 'teams-ai',
                apiKey:  process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
                indexFolder: path.join(__dirname, '../index'),
            }));

            // Add a custom response formatter to convert markdown code blocks to <pre> tags
            addResponseFormatter(app);

           ```
       
       
        1.  After adding the code to define data sources, add the following code in a new line to define actions:

            ```typescript
            // Register other AI actions
            app.ai.action(
                AI.FlaggedInputActionName,
                async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: Record<string, any>) => {
                    await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry your message was flagged: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`);
                    return AI.StopCommandName;
                }
            );

            app.ai.action(AI.FlaggedOutputActionName, async (context: TurnContext, state: ApplicationTurnState, data: any) => {
                await context.sendActivity(`I'm not allowed to talk about such things.`);
                return AI.StopCommandName;
            });
            ```
            
            When the `ActionPlanner` reviews and identifies a flag in an input or output, it triggers the action `AI.FlaggedInputActionName` or `AI.FlaggedOutputActionName` and the `context.sendActivity` sends a message to the user. If the user receives a message for an flagged  input or output, the user can control what he wants to do.

        1. Under **Import required packages**, after `restify` add `import * as path from 'path';` in a new line.

        1. Under **Import required bot service**, after `TurnContext` add `MemoryStorage`.

        1. By default, bot builder uses `bot` as a variable, as we're constructing an app for the `new Application`. We must replace `await bot.run(context)` with `await app.run(context)`.
   
    1. In the root folder, create new folders **prompts** > **chat**.

    1. Under **chat**, create the following files:
       * config.json
       * skprompt.txt

    1. Go to the `config.json` file and add the following code to create the prompt model settings:
    
        ```config.json
        {
            "schema": 1.1,
            "description": "A bot that can turn the lights on and off",
            "type": "completion",
            "completion": {
                "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
                "completion_type": "chat",
                "include_history": true,
                "include_input": true,
                "max_input_tokens": 2800,
                "max_tokens": 1000,
                "temperature": 0.2,
                "top_p": 0.0,
                "presence_penalty": 0.6,
                "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
                "stop_sequences": []
            },
            "augmentation": {
                "augmentation_type": "chat"
            }
        }
        ```

       The bot relies on OpenAI or Azure OpenAI for its natural language modelling, the `config.json` file handles the language processing for the bot. The `config.json` is initiated by the `PromptManager` from the `index.ts` file. When a prompt is initiated, the prompt manager searches for the prompt config file (chat/config.json) and passes the prompt settings into OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

    1. Go to the `skprompt.txt` file. Add the following instructions for OpenAI endpoint to conduct and facilitate conversation:

        ```text
        The following is a conversation with an AI assistant.
        The assistant can turn a light on or off.

        context:
       The lights are currently {{getLightStatus}}.

        ```

        The `skprompt.txt` file contains text prompts with which the users interact with OpenAI endpoint. OpenAI endpoint attempts to use these prompts to produce the next series of words that are most likely to follow from the previous text.

    This sample leverages OpenAI endpoint for all its natural language modelling, the user can talk to an AI bot in any language of their choosing. The bot understands and responds appropriately without extra code.

    ## Deploy your app to Azure

    Deployment consists of two steps. First, necessary cloud resources are created (also known as provisioning). Then, your app's code is copied into the created cloud resources. For this tutorial, you'll deploy the bot app.
    <br>
    <br>
    <details>
    <summary>What's the difference between Provision and Deploy?</summary>
    <br>
    The <b>Provision</b> step creates resources in Azure and Microsoft 365 for your app, but no code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is copied to the resources. The <b>Deploy</b> step copies the code for your app to the resources you created during the provision step. It's common to deploy multiple times without provisioning new resources. Since the provision step can take some time to complete, it's separate from the deployment step.
    </details>
    <br>

    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

    Select the Teams Toolkit :::image type="icon" source="assets/icons/vsc-toolkit.png" border="false"::: icon in the Visual Studio Code sidebar.

    1. Select **Provision**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/provisioning-commands.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the selection of provision in the cloud under Teams toolkit.":::

    1. Select a subscription to use for the Azure resources.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/select-resource.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the subscription to use for the Azure resources.":::

        Your app is hosted using Azure resources.

        A dialog warns you that costs might be incurred when running resources in Azure.

    1. Select **Provision**.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/provision-warning.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a dialog box that costs ma be incurred when running resources in Azure.":::

        The provisioning process creates resources in the Azure cloud. It might take some time. You can monitor the progress by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see the following notice:

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/deploy-provision-successmsgext.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a notice, which displays 'hellomsg' successfully provisioned in the cloud.":::

        If you want, you can view the provisioned resources. For this tutorial, you don't need to view resources.

        The provisioned resource appears in the **ENVIRONMENT** section.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/provisioned-resources-env.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the resource being provisioned in the environment section.":::

    1. Select **Deploy** from the **LIFECYCLE** panel after provisioning is complete.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/deploy-cloud.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing deploy to cloud.":::

        As with provisioning, deployment takes some time. You can monitor the process by watching the dialogs in the bottom-right corner. After a few minutes, you see a completion notice.

        Now, you can use the same process to deploy your Bot and Message Extension apps to Azure.

    # [Command Line](#tab/cli)

    In your terminal window:

    1. Run `teamsapp provision`.

        ``` bash
        teamsapp provision
        ```

    When prompted, select an Azure subscription to use Azure resources.

    Your app is hosted using Azure resources.

    1. Run `teamsapp deploy`.

        ``` bash
        teamsapp deploy
        ```

    ---

    ## Run the deployed app

    After the provisioning and deployment steps are complete:

    1. Open the debug panel (**Ctrl+Shift+D** / **⌘⇧-D** or **View > Run**) from Visual Studio Code.
    1. Select **Launch Remote (Edge)** from the launch configuration dropdown.
    1. Select the **Start debugging (F5)** to launch your app from Azure.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/deploy-azure/launch-remote.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the launch app remotely.":::

    1. Select **Add**.
        
        The toolkit displays a message to indicate that the app is added to Teams.

     * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
     * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

    Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

     * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
     * The frontend application is deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.
