# Actions in Copilot for Microsoft 365

Actions in Copilot for Microsoft 365 allow users to interact with applications by enabling direct engagement with external systems. Actions extend to a wide range of scenarios, from project and incident management to HR or ERP workflows, approvals, meetings, content generation, employee  recognition, and bookings. With the added advantage of AI,  Actions can generate content and perform actions based on contextual understanding, optimizing your time, and resources.

It supports cross-app integration within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, streamlining project management, incident management, HR/ERP workflows, approvals, meetings, content generation, employee recognition, and bookings. The cross-app integration allows you to access and act on data across different applications within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, ensuring a unified user experience. Action commands allow users to interact with Copilot in natural language to create or update items, tapping into Generative AI powered by company data. This simplifies tasks like ticket creation, leave requests, and sending kudos, directly within Copilotâ€™s interface.

## Build Actions in Copilot for Microsoft 365

Actions in message extension for copilot for Microsoft 365 is the process of performing actions with natural language commands in the Copilot chat window using message extension plugins. For example, users can ask Copilot to file a reimbursement claim, create a task, or add a person to a project using third-party apps. The flow consists of the following steps:

1. **Invocation**: Users initiate an action by entering a natural language query that aligns with an action's intent. The user types a natural language command in the Copilot chat window, such as "Can you file a sick leave for me?" or "Create a general issue".

1. **Disclosure and Action Confirmation UI**: Copilot responds with the parameters to be sent to the third party service, derived from the plugin manifest. A customizable action confirmation message from the third party is also displayed,  with the parameters and parameter values that are sent to the app, such as alias, claim type, category, etc. The user can modify or cancel the parameters if needed.

1. **User Action Confirmation**: Users explicitly confirm the action, which then shares the information with the plugin. The user selects on "Continue in plugin" to proceed with the action. Copilot opens a dialog with the app's dialog, prepopulated with the parameter values. The user can fill in any more details or upload files as required by the app.

1. **Completion Confirmation**: The plugin acknowledges the action's completion, potentially through an adaptive card, text, or JSON templates. The user submits the action and Copilot shows a notification with the status and outcome of the action, such as **Your details have been successfully submitted**. The user can also view or edit the action details in the app.

1. **Clarification [Optional Step]**: If essential parameters are missing, Copilot might request additional information from the user.

1. **Modification [Optional Step]**: Users can modify the disclosed information by submitting a natural language query, using rich Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to alter existing parameter values.

1. **3P Error [Optional Step]**: Should a service encounter an error, Copilot relays the plugin's error message to the user. The following errors are supported:

   1. **Recoverable Errors**:
      * **Rectification Suggestions**: Developers can send an error response to the user with requests for corrections or more data in text or JSON format.
      * **Authentication/Configuration Failure**: Developers can prompt the user to reauthorize if there's an authentication or configuration issue.

   1. **Irrecoverable Errors**:
      * **From Developer**: Developers should be able to send a failure message that Copilot displays to the user.
      * **From Copilot**: In cases of API availability issues or network problems, Copilot can send an error message to the user.

1. **Disclosure and Action Confirmation with Dialogs**: For plugins requiring complex inputs, business logic, or rich editing, a button to launch a modal-based form is provided. To ensure users have full control over their data and make changes to the data generated by Copilot, it's vital to show users the information being sent with each parameter and seek explicit confirmation before triggering an action.

1. **User Action Confirmation from Dialogs**: Users must confirm actions from dialogs to complete the process.

## Prerequisites

1. Updated your manifest to version 1.13 or later.
1. [Upgrade to Teamsjs version v2.22 or later](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teams-js)
1. Add the Microsoft 365 channel for your plugin for users to interact with your message extension from Microsoft 365 Copilot or Outlook. For more information, see Add Microsoft 365 channel.
1. If you're using single sign-on (SSO), [update your Microsoft Entra ID app registration for SSO](/m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-personal-tab?tabs=manifest-teams-toolkit#update-microsoft-entra-app-registration-for-sso).
1. If using Content Security Policy, [modify your Content Security Policy headers](/m365-apps/extend-m365-teams-personal-tab?tabs=manifest-teams-toolkit#configure-content-security-policy-headers).

## Add actions to bot-based message extension

1. **Define Parameters for Action Commands**: In your manifest, define parameters for Action commands. The bot processes the parameters. Here's an example of how to define parameters:

   ```json
   "composeExtensions": [
       {
           "commands": [
               {
                   "id": "createTask",
                   "type": "action",
                   "parameters": [
                       {
                           "name": "taskTitle",
                           "title": "Task Title",
                           "description": "Title of the task",
                           "inputType": "text"
                       },
                       {
                           "name": "taskDescription",
                           "title": "Task Description",
                           "description": "Description of the task",
                           "inputType": "textarea"
                       }
                   ]
               }
           ]
       }
   ]
   ```

   Ensure that your command and parameter descriptions are friendly to LLM, which ensures that your commands are easily understood and used by users across different locales. For example, avoid using jargon or complex language in your descriptions.

1. **Adjust bot logic**: Adjust your bot logic to process the parameters defined in the manifest. The bot should be able to handle the command and its parameters, perform the necessary actions, and return a response. To enable action commands with natural language in the Copilot chat window, the bot logic should be updated to:

   * Use the getContext API to receive the values of the parameters that are defined in the manifest and passed by Copilot.

   ```JavaScript
    await app.initialize(); 
    const context = await app.getContext(); 
    const dialogParameters = context.dialogParameters; 
    /* context.dialogParameters will contain key value pairs prepopulated by Copilot.The keys will match the parameter names specified in the manifest. 
     
    For example, if you had three parameters in your manifest called Title, Description and Date, you can access the values Copilot has prepopulated for you using dialogParameters.Title, dialogParameters.Description and dialogParameters.Date 
    */ 
    document.getElementById("Title").value = dialogParameters["Title"]; 
    document.getElementById("Summary").value = dialogParameters["Summary"]; 
    document.getElementById("Priority").value = dialogParameters["Priority"]; 
   ```

1. **Provide a synchronous card response**: For user-initiated cards, provide a synchronous card response from the dialog, which ensures that users receive immediate feedback upon initiating an action. For example, once a user creates a task, they should receive a confirmation card.
