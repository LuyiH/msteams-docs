# Resolve issues if your Teams Store submission fails

Apps published to the Microsoft Teams Store must meet the [Teams Store validation guidelines](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md) and [commercial marketplace policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies).

If your Teams Store submission fails, Microsoft provides a concierge validation service to help get your app compliant and published.

## Get help directly from Microsoft

The Microsoft concierge validation service provided by Microsoft helps developers get their apps published to the Teams Store. As part of this service, Microsoft verifies if your app works as described, contains all appropriate metadata, and provides value to users.

If your app submission fails, Microsoft sends you a review report with recommendations within 24 hours of submission.

## Resolve issues and resubmit your app

For your app to be listed on the Teams Store, it must pass both functional and validation tests. Here's the process to ensure successful listing of your app.

To list your app on the Teams Store, submit it on the Partner Center. Your app must undergo functional and validation tests. It might follow one of these two flows:

* **Successful Functional and Validation Testing**
  After the app successfully passes both functional and validation testing, it gets listed on the Teams Store.

* **Failure in Functional and Validation Testing**
  Expect to receive the review report within 24 hours after the functional and experience testing of your app. Address all issues before resubmitting your app on the Partner Center. Here's the process to fix all issues and resubmit your app:

    1. Microsoft concierge validation team shares a review report with you.
        <details>
        <summary>Select to view review report contents.</summary>

        * A [validation guideline](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md) corresponding for each issue.
        * Instructions on how to reproduce each issue.
        * Recommendations for resolving each issue based on publicly available developer documentation.

        </details>

    1. Fix all issues shared in the validation team's review report.

    1. Send the updated app to the validation team at <a href="mailto:teamsubm@microsoft.com">teamsubm@microsoft.com</a>:

        <details>
        <summary>Select to view the contents for app testing.</summary>

        * Updated app package
        * Testing notes for your app, if they were not part of your initial submission:
            * Login details for a minimum of two accounts (one administrator account and one non-administrator account).
            * Instructions to configure the app and test its functionality.
            * A video demonstrating your app operating in Teams.

        </details>

    1. The validation team conducts functional and experience testing on the updated app. The app validation might either succeed or fail.

        * If the app passes the testing process, it becomes eligible for listing on the Teams Store. You can resubmit the app on Partner Center.
        * If the app fails the testing process, the validation team provides a review report that includes issues and recommendations to resolve them.

            1. Fix all issues shared in the review report provided by the validation team.

            1. Submit your updated app package and test notes to the validation team at <a href="mailto:teamsubm@microsoft.com">teamsubm@microsoft.com</a>.

            This allows the validation team to conduct another round of testing on your app. The process continues until the app fully complies with the validation guidelines.

            > [!CAUTION]
            > To prevent repeated submission failures, resubmit your app on Partner Center only after the validation team has approved your app.
