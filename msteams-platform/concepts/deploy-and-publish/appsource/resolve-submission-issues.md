# Resolve issues if your Teams Store submission fails

Apps published to the Microsoft Teams Store must meet the [Teams Store validation guidelines](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md) and [commercial marketplace policies](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies).

If your Teams Store submission fails, Microsoft provides a concierge validation service to help get your app compliant and published.

## Get help directly from Microsoft

The concierge validation service provided by Microsoft helps developers get their apps published to the Teams Store. As part of this service, Microsoft verifies if your app works as described, contains all appropriate metadata, and provides value to users.

If your app submission fails, Microsoft sends you a review report with recommendations within 24 hours of submission.

### Resolve issues and resubmit your app

After you receive the review report, you must fix all issues reported by the Microsoft concierge validation team before resubmitting your app on Partner Center.

The Microsoft report includes the following information:

* A corresponding [validation guideline](~/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/teams-store-validation-guidelines.md) for each issue.
* Instructions on how to reproduce each issue.
* Recommendations for resolving each issue based on publicly available developer documentation.

After resolving all issues shared in the review report, submit your updated app the to Partner Centre. Send the following to the Microsoft concierge validation team at <a href="mailto:teamsubm@microsoft.com">teamsubm@microsoft.com</a>:

* Updated app package
* Test notes for your app, if they weren't included in your original submission:
  * Credentials for at least two accounts (one admin and one non-admin).
  * Instructions to configure the app and test its functionality.
  * A video showing your app used in Teams.

Let's look at the process to resubmit the app to Teams Store.

Following app submission, the process for resolving issues and resubmitting an app involves the following steps:

1. Microsoft concierge validation team takes the updated app through functional and experience testing. Following the testing, the app validation may either pass or fail.
1. If the app passes the testing process, it is listed on the Teams Store.
1. If the app fails the testing process, the Microsoft concierge validation team sends you a detailed report with recommendations for resolving issues found in the app. You can expect to receive this report within 24 hours of your app's functional and experience testing.
1. Resolve the issues shared in the report sent by the Microsoft concierge validation team.
1. Resubmit your updated app to <a href="mailto:teamsubm@microsoft.com">teamsubm@microsoft.com</a> after resolving issues, so that the app may be tested again.

The process continues till the app is found fully validated as per Microsoft validation guidelines.

> [!CAUTION]
> To avoid multiple submission failures, resubmit your app on Partner Center only after the Microsoft concierge validation team approves your app.
