# Monetize your Teams app

App monetization is an essential phase in the app development process, and Microsoft Teams Store provides a platform to monetize your app. You can create offers for your apps in Microsoft Partner Center and publish in Teams Store to reach customers with the best solutions.

Microsoft commercial marketplace facilitates publishing offers through Azure Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource. When published, they are available as software as a service (SaaS) offers for purchase from commercial marketplace. If the SaaS offers are linked to Teams app, it can be purchased from Teams Store.

## SaaS offer

SaaS offers play a crucial role for businesses aiming to leverage their apps to generate revenue. SaaS apps that are published in commercial marketplace with subscriptions for purchase are SaaS offers. As a publisher, you can create your marketplace offers in Partner Center, link the offer to your app, and publish the SaaS app for purchase.

The publishing options available in a SaaS offer by which you can drive app monetization are:

* **Subscription**: You can provide transactable offers that can be purchased. You can also provide a free app or allow your customers to bring their own licenses.

* **Free trial**: You can provide free access to your app for a limited time or functionality. This encourages users to purchase the full version after the trial period.

* **Test drive**: You can provide access to preconfigured environment for a fixed period and encourage users to purchase. Test drive and free trials are different, and you can provide one or both the features to the customers.

* **Contact me**: You can allow users to contact you for specific offers, unique requirements, and any enquiries.

When creating a SaaS offer, you must determine the publishing option, that is, if you're selling through Microsoft or managing transactions independently. For more information on publishing options, see [plan for a SaaS offer](include-saas-offer.md).

Here are the other features associated with a SaaS offer:

* **In-app purchases**: Allow users to upgrade from a free to a paid version within the app. Whether your app is free or paid, [in-app purchases](in-app-purchase-flow.md) can generate an ongoing revenue stream. </br>

* **Microsoft license management**: Enable Microsoft to manage app licenses on your behalf to track and manage licenses from the Teams Store. For more information, see [set up Microsoft license management](manage-third-party-apps-license.md#set-up-microsoft-license-management).

### Private plans

Private plan provides customized solutions for targeted customers based on their organizational requirements. You can either use an existing offer or a new offer to create a private plan. For more information, see [private plans in commercial marketplace](/partner-center/marketplace/private-plans).
