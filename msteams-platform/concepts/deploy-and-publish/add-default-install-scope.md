# Configure default options for Teams app

Itâ€™s common for an app to support multiple scenarios in Microsoft Teams, but you might have designed it with a specific scope and capability in mind. For example, if your app is primarily intended for use within a team or channel, you can ensure that users only view that specific scope when they install your app from Microsoft Teams Store.

When the user selects an app to install from Teams Store, the app gets installed and a dialog appears to select the install scope.

If your app's primary capability is a bot, you can also make the bot the default capability when a user installs your app to a team.

## Configure your app's default install scope

Default install scope allows you to specify whether your app is available for personal, team, or meeting scopes. You can configure the app's default install scope and can set only one scope at a time. For more information, see [app manifest](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#defaultinstallscope).

To configure the default install scope in your app manifest:

1. Open your app manifest and add the `defaultInstallScope` property.
2. Set default install scope value as, either `personal`, `team`, `groupchat`, or `meetings`.

    ```json
    "defaultInstallScope": "meetings",
    ```

### App install user experience

App installation within the configured default install scope such as personal, channel, chat, and meeting scopes is quick and straightforward. The following procedures outline the user flow for installing an app within the configured scope.

<summary>Personal scope only</summary>

If the app is configured with personal scope only, here's the user flow to add the app:

1. Go to **Apps** and browse and select the app to install.

1. In the app details dialog, select **Add**.

    When the app is added, a dialog appears to open the app in personal scope.

1. Select **Open**. The app opens in personal scope.

<summary>Personal and shared scopes</summary>

If the app is configured with personal and shared scope, here's the user flow to add the app in the required scope:

1. Go to **Apps** and browse and select the app to install.

1. In the app details dialog, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/compose-extensions/app-add-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the app details dialog with the Add option highlighted.":::

     When the app is added, a dialog appears to select the scope.

1. Select **Open** to add in personal scope.

    Alternatively, you can select from the list of suggested scopes or search and select the required shared scope.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/compose-extensions/personal-other-scope.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the scope selection dialog with Open option and also the search option to select from shared scopes.":::

    The app opens in the respective scope.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > * **Recommended** button indicates the scope where the app provides best usage experience.
    > * **View more** option lists the respective channel, chat, and meetings scopes available for the user.

</details>

<summary>Shared scope</summary>

If the app is configured with shared scope, here's the user flow to add the app in the required scope:

1. Go to **Apps** and browse and select the app to install.

1. In the app details dialog, select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/compose-extensions/app-add-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the app details dialog with the Add option highlighted.":::

    When the app is added, a dialog appears to select the scope.

1. Select from the list of suggested scopes or search and select the required shared scope. The app opens in the respective scope.

## Configure the default capability for shared scopes

Configure the default capability when your app is installed for a team, meeting, or groupchat. For more information, see [app manifest](../../resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#defaultgroupcapability).

> [!NOTE]
> `defaultGroupCapability` provides the default capability that's added to the team, group chat, or meeting. Select a tab, bot, or connector as the default capability for your app, but you must ensure that you have provided the selected capability in your app definition.

To configure details in app manifest:

1. Open your app manifest and add the `defaultGroupCapability` property to it.
2. Set a value of `team`, `groupchat`, or `meetings`.
3. For the selected group capability, the available group capabilities are, `bot`, `tab`, or `connector`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can select only one default capability, `bot`, `tab`, or `connector` for the selected group capability.

    ```json
    "defaultGroupCapability": {
        "team": "bot",
        "groupchat": "bot",
        "meetings": "tab"
    }
    ```

## Block apps by default for users until an admin approves

To enhance the user experience of a Teams app, at times, IT administrators must intervene before users use the app. For example, consider a help desk app created by Contoso Electronics for Teams. To ensure the app functions properly, Contoso Electronics wants customers to configure specific properties of the app first.

To ensure that IT admins perform the relevant tasks, developers can block an app for users until an admin allows the app. To block the app by default, set the `defaultBlockUntilAdminAction` property to `true` in the app manifest file. When the property is set to `true`, the status of the app in Teams admin center is **Blocked by publisher** in the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/manage-apps-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an app blocked by publisher." lightbox="../../assets/images/manage-apps-status-expanded.png":::

The admins can do their due diligence about your app and they can read the [app documentation that you provide]() before they allow their users to use your app. For example, the admins can purchase the required licenses and distribute the licenses before allowing users to use the app. To allow the app with **Blocked by publisher** status, an admin can select **Allow** in the **[Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)** page in Teams admin center.

:::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/manage-apps-allow.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the Allow option for the app blocked by publisher." lightbox="../../assets/images/manage-apps-allow-expanded.png":::

If you don't want your app to be blocked by default, update the `defaultBlockUntilAdminAction` setting to `false` and submit your updated app for publishing. After we publish the new version of your app, it's allowed by default.

> [!NOTE]
> For custom apps built for your org, `defaultBlockUntilAdminAction` isn't supported. If you upload a custom app built for your organization with this property, the app isn't blocked.
