# Create a tab

Tabs are part of the Teams apps that can be pinned to the left navigation bar for easy access and behave more like apps, as you can pin only one tab per app. 

Static tabs work in personal chat, group chat, channels, and meetings with a customizable experience. 

Ensure that you've all the [prerequisites](~/tabs/how-to/tab-requirements.md) to build your static tab.

## Take a tour of the tab app source code

Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the **Explorer** in the Visual Studio Code.

:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-tab/folder-structure-tab-app.png" alt-text="Screen shot shows the structure tab.":::

Although you're free to choose any UI framework (or not to use any), this sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components.

Among other items in this directory structure, the Toolkit maintains:

| Folder name | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `.vscode` | VSCode files for debugging. |
| `appPackage` | Templates for the Teams application manifest. |
| `env` | Name / value pairs are stored in environment files and used by teamsapp.yml to customize the provisioning and deployment rules. |
| `infra` | Templates for provisioning Azure resources. |
| `src/`| The source code for the notification Teams application. |
| `src/app.js` | Application entry point and `restify` handlers for website. |
| `src/views/hello.html`| A HTML template that is bind to the tab endpoint. |
| `src/static` | The static assets like CSS and JavaScript files that can be served by the web server. |
| `teamsapp.yml` | Main project file describes your application configuration and defines the set of actions to run in each lifecycle stages. |
| `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging. |

## Build and run your first tab app

#### Startup.cs

This project was created from an ASP.NET Core 3.1 web application empty template with the **Advanced - Configure for HTTPS** check box selected at setup. The MVC services are registered by the dependency injection framework's `ConfigureServices()` method. Additionally, the empty template doesn't enable serving static content by default, so the static files middleware is added to the `Configure()` method using the following code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);
  }
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
  {
    app.UseStaticFiles();
    app.UseMvc();
  }
```

#### wwwroot folder

In ASP.NET Core, the web root folder is where the application looks for static files.

#### Index.cshtml

ASP.NET Core treats files called **Index** as the default or home page for the site. When your browser URL points to the root of the site, **Index.cshtml** is displayed as the home page for your application.

#### AppManifest folder

This folder contains the following required app package files:

* A full color icon measuring 192 x 192 pixels.
* A transparent outline icon measuring 32 x 32 pixels.
* A `manifest.json` file that specifies the attributes of your app.

These files must be zipped in an app package for use in uploading your tab to Teams. Teams loads the `contentUrl` specified in your manifest, embeds it in an <iframe\>, and renders it in your tab.

#### .csproj

In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select **Edit Project File**. At the end of the file, you can see the following code that creates and updates your zip folder when the application builds:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <PostBuildEvent>powershell.exe Compress-Archive -Path \"$(ProjectDir)AppManifest\*\" -DestinationPath \"$(TargetDir)tab.zip\" -Force</PostBuildEvent>
  </PropertyGroup>

    > In a tab, the tab home page appears only when the user selects the back button (or moves out of the tab) and comes back to the home page. The tab doesn't maintain or retain the previous state by design.
    </details>

### Add a content page to the static tab

Create a content page and update the existing files of the static tab application:

1. Create a new **personal.html** file in your Visual Studio Code with the following markup:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>
                <!-- Todo: add your a title here -->
            </title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            <!-- inject:css -->
            <!-- endinject -->
        </head>
            <body>
                <h1>Personal Tab</h1>
                <p><img src="/assets/icon.png"></p>
                <p>This is your personal tab!</p>
            </body>
    </html>
    ```

1. Save **personal.html** in your application's **public** folder in the following location:

    ```
    ./src/public/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html
    ```

1. Open `manifest.json` from the following location in your Visual Studio Code:

    ```
     ./src/manifest/manifest.json
    ```

1. Add the following to the empty `staticTabs` array (`staticTabs":[]`) and add the following JSON object:

    ```json
    {
        "entityId": "personalTab",
        "name": "Personal Tab ",
        "contentUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/personal.html",
        "websiteUrl": "https://{{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}}",
        "scopes": ["personal"]
    }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** is the value that you entered in the generator for **Default Tab Name** plus the word **Tab**.
    >
    > For example: DefaultTabName is **MyTab** then **/MyTabTab/**

1. Update the **contentURL** path component **yourDefaultTabNameTab** with your actual tab name.

1. Save the updated `manifest.json` file.

1. Open **Tab.ts** in your Visual Studio Code from the following path to provide your content page in an iFrame:

    ```bash
    ./src/server/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>/<yourDefaultTabNameTab>.ts
    ```

1. Add the following to the list of iFrame decorators:

    ```typescript
     @PreventIframe("/<yourDefaultTabName Tab>/personal.html")
    ```

1. Save the updated file. Your tab code is complete.

### Create your app package

You must have an app package to build and run your application in Teams. The app package is created through a gulp task that validates the `manifest.json` file and generates the zip folder in the `./package` directory. At the command prompt, use the command `gulp manifest`.

### Build and run your application

#### Build your application

Enter the following command at the command prompt to transpile your solution into the **./dist** folder:

```cmd
gulp build
```

#### Run your application

1. At the command prompt, enter the following command to start a local web server:

    ```cmd
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Enter `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/` in your browser to view your application's home page.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/homePage.png" alt-text="Default Tab":::

1. Browse `http://localhost:3007/<yourDefaultAppNameTab>/personal.html`, to view your static tab.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personalTab.PNG" alt-text="Default html Tab":::

### Establish a secure tunnel to your tab

At the command prompt exit the localhost and enter the following command to establish a secure tunnel to your tab:

```cmd
gulp ngrok-serve
```

After your tab is uploaded to Microsoft Teams through **ngrok** and successfully saved, you can view it in Teams until your tunnel session ends.

### Upload your application to Teams

1. Go to Teams and select **Apps**&nbsp;:::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/store.png" alt-text="Microsoft Teams Store":::.
1. Select **Manage your apps** > **Upload an app** > **Upload a custom app**.
1. Go to your project directory, browse to the **./package** folder, select the zip folder, and choose **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/addingpersonaltab.png" alt-text="Adding your static tab":::

1. Select **Add** in the dialog. Your tab is uploaded to Teams.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/tab-images/personaltabuploaded.png" alt-text="Personal tab uploaded":::

1. In the left pane of Teams, select ellipses &#x25CF;&#x25CF;&#x25CF; and then choose your uploaded app to view your static tab.

   Your static tab is successfully created and added in Teams.You can also [reorder](#reorder-static-tabs) your static tab in Teams.

::: zone-end


## Reorder static tabs

Starting with manifest version 1.7, developers can rearrange all tabs in their static tab app. You can move the **bot chat** tab, which always defaults to the first position, anywhere in the Teams app tab header. Two reserved tab `entityId` keywords are declared, **conversations** and **about**.

If you create a bot with a **personal** scope, it appears in the first tab position in a personal app by default. If you want to move it to another position, you must add a static tab object to your manifest with the reserved keyword, **conversations**. The **conversation** tab appears on web or desktop depending on where you add the **conversation** tab in the `staticTabs` array.

``` JSON

{
   "staticTabs":[
      {
         
      },
      {
         "entityId":"conversations",
         "scopes":[
            "personal"
         ]
      }
   ]
}

```

## Extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings

> [!NOTE]
> To extend your static tab to group chat, channels, and meetings, use the app manifest v1.16 or later.

You can extend static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings. Instead of pinned app content, you can build tabs that behave more like apps as you can pin only one tab per app, for example, pinning a single YouTube app tab.

To extend your static tabs to group chat, channels, and meetings, update your [app manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema.md#statictabs) with the `scopes` and `context` parameters in the `staticTabs` property.

Following is an example of app manifest where a static tab is defined that works in all scopes and contexts in Teams:

```json
"staticTabs": [ 
  { 
     "entityId": "homeTab", 
     "scopes": [ 
       "personal", 
       "groupChat", 
       "team"
      ], 
     "context": [ 
       "personalTab",
       "channelTab", 
       "privateChatTab", 
       "meetingChatTab", 
       "meetingDetailsTab", 
       "meetingSidePanel", 
       "meetingStage" 
      ], 
      "name": "Contoso", 
      "contentUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in Teams canvas)", 
      "websiteUrl": "https://contoso.com/content (displayed in web browser)" 
  }
], 

```

If a context isn't defined in the app manifest, by default Teams consider the following context:

```json
"context": [ 
   "personalTab",
   "channelTab",
   "privateChatTab", 
   "meetingChatTab", 
   "meetingDetailsTab", 
   "meetingStage" 
]
```

## Customizing your static tab in chats or meetings

To customize your static tab experience in chats, channels, or meetings, you can use the `setConfig` APIs in your tab to update the `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl`. Following is an example:

```json
pages.config.setConfig({ 
  "contentUrl": "https://wwww.contoso.com/teamsapp/thread/" + context.threadId,
   ...}

```

Only `contentUrl` and `websiteUrl` changes are supported for `setConfig`, other properties can't be changed for static tabs.
