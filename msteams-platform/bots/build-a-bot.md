# Let's build a bot

Building a bot app involves various phases, from initial concept to final deployment. This article offers a summary of your options to help you get started.

If you want to create your own bot, here's a list of tools and platforms to help you get started:

| # | Choose ... | From the following options ... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Bot capabilities | - AI bot <br> - Non-AI bot: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Conversational capability <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Notification capability <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Workflow capability <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Command capability |
| 2. | Tools and Platforms | - **Teams AI library**: <br> A Teams AI bot uses artificial intelligence (AI) technology to communicate with users in natural language, similar to a human-to-human conversation. These bots can handle a variety of tasks, from answering simple questions to performing complex operations. If you've built your bot app using Bot Framework SDK, you can migrate your bot to use Teams AI library to utilize its advanced AI capabilities. <br> For more information, see [why you should migrate to the Teams AI library](https://github.com/microsoft/teams-ai/tree/main/getting-started/migration). <br> <br> - **Bot Framework SDK**: <br> The [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) is a rich SDK used to create bots using C#, Python, and JavaScript. If you already have a bot that is based on the Bot Framework, you can easily modify it to work in Teams. Use either C# or Node.js to take advantage of our [SDKs](/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true). These packages extend the basic Bot Builder SDK classes and methods as follows: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Use specialized card types like the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Set Teams-specific channel data on activities. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; • Process message extension requests. <br> You can develop Teams apps in any web programming technology and call the [Bot Framework REST APIs](/bot-framework/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-overview) directly. You must perform token handling in all cases. <br> <br> - **Teams Toolkit**: <br> Teams Toolkit makes it simple to get started with bot app development for Teams. You can begin with a project template for common custom bot app built for your org (LOB app) scenarios or start from a sample. <br> For more information, see [tools and SDKs](../concepts/build-and-test/tool-sdk-overview.md). <br> <br> - **Azure AI bot service**:  <br> Azure AI Bot Service is a cloud platform. It hosts bots and makes them available to channels, such as Microsoft Teams, Facebook, or Slack. <br> The Bot Framework Service, which is a component of the Azure AI Bot Service, sends information between the< user's bot-connected app and the bot. Each channel can include additional information in the activities they send. <br> For more information, see [Azure AI bot service](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics). |
| 3. | Bot registration service | - Azure AD <br> - Developer Portal |
| 4. | Advanced bot capabilities | - Call and media bot <br> - Access data using MS Graph <br> - SSO <br> - Bot on Mobile |

## Build a bot

Let's start by building a conversational bot. You can use Teams Toolkit, Bot Framework SDK, or Teams AI library.

| # | I want to build ... | Here's a sample |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | AI bot with Teams AI library and Teams Toolkit | [Build a custom engine agent](../Teams-AI-library-tutorial.yml) |
| 2. | Conversational bot with Bot Framework SDK | - [Bot app with Node.js](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/bot-conversation/nodejs) <br> - [Bot app with C#](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/bot-conversation/csharp) <br> - [Bot app with Python](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/bot-conversation/python) |
| 3. | Conversational bot with Teams Toolkit | [Create Teams conversation bot](../sbs-teams-conversation-bot.yml) |

## Understand bot basics

Let's learn about some common bot elements and how they work together to make a bot effective within Teams.

* **Activity handler**: This component manages and processes events or activities generated by users interacting with the bot. These activities can include text or image messages, bot events like users joining or leaving, @mentions, user actions such as booking or ordering through the bot, and handling errors.
* **Events**: These are occurrences triggered during a user's interaction with a bot, prompting the bot to respond or take action. Events can be initiated when the user sends a message, selects a button, shares inputs, and more.
* **Conversation**: This is an interactive exchange between a user and a bot, which can include text or voice messaging. A conversation involves user inputs, the bot's responses, the context of the conversation such as history and state, the intent of the conversation (the user's goal or purpose), and dialog that can be a multi-turn exchange.
* **Bot logic**: This is one of the components of conversation logic (along side activity handler) that defines decision-making processes, integrating rules, conditions, and more.
* **Bot scope**: This pertains to the specification and constraints of a bot's capabilities within Microsoft Teams. A bot can be deployed in Teams as a personal chatbot, within a group chat, or within a channel.
