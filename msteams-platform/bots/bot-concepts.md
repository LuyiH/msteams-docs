# Understand bot concepts

A bot's interactions can be using text, speech, images, or video. It processes the user's input to understand their request, evaluates the input to perform relevant tasks. A bot may request information or enable access to services, and responds to the user.

To develop a bot app that meets your needs, it's important to get to know the bot activity handler and bot logic. These two components work together to create a smooth and engaging conversational experience. The activity handler processes what the user says, while the bot logic figures out the best response. Together, they enable:

- Understanding the context of the conversation
- Personalizing interactions
- Retrieving information efficiently
- Maintaining an adaptive conversational flow

By understanding the activity handler and bot logic, you can design and implement smart, user-friendly conversational AI and non-AI bot solutions.
